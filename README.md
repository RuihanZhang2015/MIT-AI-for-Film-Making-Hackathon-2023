### Modify images
 
- [Clip Drop](https://clipdrop.co/)

   Modify lighting, remove object, background

- [Inpainting @ Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/research/inpainting/index.html)

   Image Inpainting lets you edit images with a smart retouching brush
   
- [Imagen Editor @ Google](https://imagen.research.google/editor/)
  
   Text-guided image editing can have a transformative impact in supporting creative applications. A key challenge is to generate edits that are faithful to input text prompts, while consistent with input images. We present Imagen Editor, a cascaded diffusion model built by fine-tuning Imagen on text-guided image inpainting. Imagen Editor's edits are faithful to the text prompts, which is accomplished by using object detectors to propose inpainting masks during training.
  
- [Outpainting](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-introducing-outpainting/)

   Outpainting, users can extend the original image, creating large-scale images in any aspect ratio. Outpainting takes into account the image’s existing visual elements — including shadows, reflections, and textures — to maintain the context of the original image.
